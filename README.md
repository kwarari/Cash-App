# FinTech Case Study

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company

**Square Inc**

![Square Image](https://g.foolcdn.com/art/companylogos/mark/SQ.png)

* When was the company incorporated?

February 2009

* Who are the founders of the company?

*Jack Dorsey* and *Jim McKelvey*

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

The original inspiration for Square occurred to Jack Dorsey in 2009 when Jim McKelvey (co-founder of Square and Dorsey's friend) was in an art fair and couldn’t sell a piece of glass because he couldn’t accept a credit card; so that was $2,000 lost.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

At it's onset, the company received funding from angel investors such as **Marissa Mayer, Kevin Rose, Biz Stone** among others. Since then it has raised additional rounds of funds through various venture capitalist firms such as **Khosla ventures, Sequoia caapital, Citi ventures, Goldmans sachs** e.t.c
In Nov 2009 square Inc went public and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange for $9 per share. At the time the company valuation was $2.9 billion. By August 2020, Square's market capitalization grew to $66.5 billion and traded above $151 per share.

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

By combining point-of-sale software and hardware , Square has disrupted the credit card payments establishment while making credit card processing more accessible to small businesses everywhere. Before Square, it was illegal for non-registered merchants to accept credit card payments. Registering was a costly and difficult process that most small business owners couldn’t afford. These business owners struggled with the reality that while most people carried plastic instead of cash, the costs and complexity of credit card processing made it impractical to accept credit cards.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

Square was intended for all business owners however over the time, it's services have proved to be more advantageous to small businesses. Less than a decade since it's creation, square had been downloaded over 33.5 million times by small businesses who use it to track sales, inventory and track credit card payments.

The **small business administartion**(SBA) definea a small business as a firm which has fewer than 500 employees. There are [30.7 million small businesses](https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/23142610/2019-Small-Business-Profiles-States-Territories.pdf) in the U.S. which account for 99.9 percent of all U.S. businesses (SBA, 2019). 

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

The company uses technology capable of aggregating merchant services and mobile payments into a single, easy-to-use service. Compared to their, competitors square enable sellers to turn mobile devices and computing devices into payments and point-of-sale solutions. Once a seller downloads the Square Point of Sale mobile application, they can accept payments in person via magnetic stripe (a swipe), Europay, MasterCard, and Visa (EMV) (a dip), or Near Field Communication (NFC) (a tap); or online via Square Invoices, Square Virtual Terminal, or the seller's Website

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

The comapny uses a wide variety of technologies listed below;
1) *Cleanse* - Cleanse is a Swift dependency injection framework that is used to wire libraries. Wiring libraries, simply put, is where dependency injection is performed via Cleanse by creating bindings, modules, and components for the objects that are injected into the applications.
2) *Using AWS Lambda Extensions to Accelerate AWS Secrets Manager Access* - AWS Lambda Extensions are a new way for tools to integrate deeply into the Lambda environment, and they can run before the start of a Lambda function. This allows square to perform preparatory tasks that are only necessary on a cold start.
3) *Radiography* - a small library for looking at view hierarchies with text-ray vision. This library is used to provide context in automated crash reports and help debug development apps. Recently the code has been coverted to Kotlin and the API has been modernized.

4) *Ruby 3* - Ruby 3 has been to add type checking tooling. 

5) *Enabling AWS Lambda Functions to call into the Square datacenter’s envoy service mesh* thus enabling Serverless Applications at Square.

6) *Anvil* - Anvil is a Kotlin compiler plugin that automatically adds Dagger modules and component interfaces to the required Dagger components.

7) *Atlas* - Atlas helps machine learning practitioners take projects from 0 to 100 fast, with features that make it easy to run, evaluate and deploy thousands of experiments concurrently. Atlas consists of a Python SDK, CLI, GUI & Scheduler.

8) *PySurvival* - PySurvival is an open source python package for Survival Analysis modeling — the modeling concept used to analyze or predict when an event is likely to happen. It is built on top the most commonly used machine learning packages: NumPy, SciPy, and PyTorch.

9) *Beta* **(*a booking API*)** - Beta enables square to create a free online booking website that manages scheduling, staffing, inventory, customers, and payments in a single point of sale. 

10) *OAuth Revocation Webhook* - OAuth revocation events make it easier for developers to respond when a connected merchant revokes all access tokens, or when an application revokes access/refresh tokens granted to it. Revocation webhooks can help reduce occurrences of 401 Unauthorized errors due to revoked access tokens, and provide revocation visibility for purposes of security auditing and application usage analytics.


## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

Square Inc is mainly in the payments/billing domain. However with it's ongoing trends and innovations, the company is also moving into the ledning domain.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

**Mobile Wallet** -  This is a virtual wallet that stores payment card information on a mobile device. Instead of paying with cash, cheque, or credit cards, a consumer can use a mobile to pay for a wide range of services and digital or hard goods. Major key palyers in this trend include Google pay, Apple pay, Samsung pay, Paypal, venmo e.t.c

**Near Field Paymant (NFC)** - These are contactless payments that use near-field communication (NFC) technology to exchange data between readers and payment devices in smartphones and smartwatches, or tap-to-pay credit and debit cards. NFC devices must be close together (typically less than 2 inches apart) to complete these contactless payments. Popular NFC payment solutions include Google pay and Apple pay. A specialized card reader such as the ones offered by square and paypal are needed to accept this payment type.

**Mobile POint Of Sale (mPOS)** - This is a portable point of sale on a smart phone or tablet that acts as a register. It's an ideal way for businisses such as food trucks and market vendors e.t.c to take credit cards on the go. Major key players include, Square, Shopify, Shopkeep by lightspeed, Lightspeed, clover e.t.c
![mPOS](https://m.foolcdn.com/media/the-blueprint/images/Mobile_POS_01_square_smartphone_swipe_reader.width-800.jpg)

**Point Of Sale (POS) System** - This is the hardware and software that enables a business to accept payments from customers and keep track of sales. A point-of-sale system used to refer to the cash register at a store.

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

Paypal, venmo, Google wallet, Intuit Inc, Apple pay

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

Square offers competitive pricing on all of its services for merchants of all sizes because it has several avenues through which to monetize those services.

Square creates value by enabling small merchants to take card payments. Whether it's through an invoice, an online appointment, or some other means, the value is generally derived from being able to take the payment type the customer chooses. Square gives away software for appointments and invoices for free, and but charges business owners a higher rate for payments.

Square does a lot with pricing when it has the ability to monetize services in multiple ways. If a merchant comes to Square and says a competitor is offering a better price for certain services, Square can come back and offer the same price while working with the merchant to monetize its business in other services. By sing a dynamic pricing model depending on how the merchant wants to pay, square provides incentive for it's customers to take multiple services. This also ecourages large mercahnts to take multiple products.

Square offers faster payment processing and you can be paid as soon as the next business day. Each transaction takes less time than waiting for approval and printing a receipt. 

With square also comes a flat fee option. Square charges 2.6% for every electronic swipe. There are no monthly fees or set up costs involved.

With the introduction of cashapp, square eliminates the need to have physical forms of payments like cash and credit cards in order to pay for goods and services. All you need is a smart phone with the the app downloaded and you can use the cashapp as your digital wallet and use it where it is accepted.


* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics? How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

Companies in this domain use the pricing strategy to measure success. They check the affordability of the software and hardware, the merchant fees charged as well as the ease to use the software as a bechmarking tool. With no hidden fees, zero monthly or annual subscription fees for their software and hardware, Square is highly rated in this domain. Their merchant rates are also on the lower percentile which gives them an even high competitive advantage. With the introduction of square appointment, square payroll, and the ability to track sales and inbuilt invoices, square has attracted more merchants as they are able to use these services which creat a one stop shop to running a small business with ease. From accepting payments through the POS system with ease and at a minimum cost to paying your employees through square payroll, automatic filing of business and payroll taxes and sending quarterly payments to the IRS, it's safe to say square has it all. Even if a merchant might prefer to use an alternative POS sytem other than square, they may end up using square anyway because of the other products they offer that make it easier to operate a business and give you a peace of mind.

Here's a list of fees you won't pay when you use Square as your processing company: 

* No application or setup fee
* No monthly fee (sometimes called a statement fee)
* No monthly minimum processing requirement
* No payment gateway setup fee
* No monthly payment gateway fee
* No annual fee
* No PCI compliance fee or PCI noncompliance fee
* No early termination or account closure fees
* No chargeback fee 


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

One major product that I would advise square to incorporate would be the online payment option to customers during checkout on online purchases. This is a field that has been mainly dominated by major key player; Paypal.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

Given all the products that we have mentioned, we see that square is **almost** monopolizing the market in this domain. There are offering some of the products that square offers however, it's ability to provide low flexible prices gives them an advantage over the rest. However for a merchant who has a brick and motor store and also provides online services, they can only use square in-store but will be forced to use another company to receive their online sales payments. With the online checkout option, square will completely take over this domain and leave little to no room for comppetition. The idea behind is to give customers an ability to make safe and easy transactions online without involving credit or debit cards.


* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

Just like the other firms in this domain, the technologies used will be Java to JavaScript and Node.js. Node.js will help bridge the browser and server applications to be written in JavaScript.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

 These technologies will unify engineering specialties into one team which allows them to understand and react to users’ needs at any level in the technology stack.
