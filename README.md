*Jack Dorsey* and *Jim McKelvey*

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

The original inspiration for Square occurred to Jack Dorsey in 2009 when Jim McKelvey (co-founder of Square and Dorsey's friend) was in an art fair and couldn’t sell a piece of glass because he couldn’t accept a credit card; so that was $2,000 lost.

At it's onset, the company received funding from angel investors such as **Marissa Mayer, Kevin Rose, Biz Stone** among others. Since then it has raised additional rounds of funds through various venture capitalist firms such as **Khosla ventures, Sequoia caapital, Citi ventures, Goldmans sachs** e.t.c
In Nov 2009 square Inc went public and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange for $9 per share. At the time the company valuation was $2.9 billion. By August 2020, Square's market capitalization grew to $66.5 billion and traded above $151 per share.

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

By combining point-of-sale software and hardware , Square has disrupted the credit card payments establishment while making credit card processing more accessible to small businesses everywhere. Before Square, it was illegal for non-registered merchants to accept credit card payments. Registering was a costly and difficult process that most small business owners couldn’t afford. These business owners struggled with the reality that while most people carried plastic instead of cash, the costs and complexity of credit card processing made it impractical to accept credit cards.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

Square was intended for all business owners however over the time, it's services have proved to be more advantageous to small businesses. Less than a decade since it's creation, square had been downloaded over 33.5 million times by small businesses who use it to track sales, inventory and track credit card payments.

The **small business administartion**(SBA) definea a small business as a firm which has fewer than 500 employees. There are [30.7 million small businesses](https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/23142610/2019-Small-Business-Profiles-States-Territories.pdf) in the U.S. which account for 99.9 percent of all U.S. businesses (SBA, 2019). 

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

The company uses technology capable of aggregating merchant services and mobile payments into a single, easy-to-use service. Compared to their, competitors square enable sellers to turn mobile devices and computing devices into payments and point-of-sale solutions. Once a seller downloads the Square Point of Sale mobile application, they can accept payments in person via magnetic stripe (a swipe), Europay, MasterCard, and Visa (EMV) (a dip), or Near Field Communication (NFC) (a tap); or online via Square Invoices, Square Virtual Terminal, or the seller's Website

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

Square offers competitive pricing on all of its services for merchants of all sizes because it has several avenues through which to monetize those services.

Square creates value by enabling small merchants to take card payments. Whether it's through an invoice, an online appointment, or some other means, the value is generally derived from being able to take the payment type the customer chooses. Square gives away software for appointments and invoices for free, and but charges business owners a higher rate for payments.

Square does a lot with pricing when it has the ability to monetize services in multiple ways. If a merchant comes to Square and says a competitor is offering a better price for certain services, Square can come back and offer the same price while working with the merchant to monetize its business in other services. By sing a dynamic pricing model depending on how the merchant wants to pay, square provides incentive for it's customers to take multiple services. This also ecourages large mercahnts to take multiple products.

Square offers faster payment processing and you can be paid as soon as the next business day. Each transaction takes less time than waiting for approval and printing a receipt. 

With square also comes a flat fee option. Square charges 2.6% for every electronic swipe. There are no monthly fees or set up costs involved.

With the introduction of cashapp, square eliminates the need to have physical forms of payments like cash and credit cards in order to pay for goods and services. All you need is a smart phone with the the app downloaded and you can use the cashapp as your digital wallet and use it where it is accepted.
